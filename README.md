# LGGL
**L**oren **G**oodwin's **G**ame **L**auncher: A cross-platform Node.js based game launcher.

I designed this largely to suit my needs so it might be tailored to my preferences in ways that don't work for you. If people feel like contributing, maybe we can make it more flexible, idk.

## Usage
Usage of this is not that straightforward since I mostly made it for myself. Non-exhaustive list of requirements:

- A PostgreSQL database (you probably want one on your local network)
- A FontAwesome Pro license (for the icons)

## License
Idk, I'll decide at some point. For now, unlicensed.
