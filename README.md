# LGGL
**L**oren **G**oodwin's **G**ame **L**auncher: A cross-platform Node.js based game launcher.

I made this to have an alternative to [Playnite](https://playnite.link/) for my upcoming switch to Linux on my main computer. I also wanted various categorization features that were lacking in Playnite (which is saying a lot, because it's great!).

This is not really ready for anyone but me to use, so probably use Playnite if you've come across this somehow but if you're still interested for some reason, maybe the sections below will help you out.

## Prerequisites
You will need **Node.js 22.12.0 or higher** installed. It might work in earlier versions, but I haven't tested it nor do I intend to.

## Usage
TODO
